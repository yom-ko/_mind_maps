My conceptual mindmaps (mental models) of how things work in the JavaScript world. I try to keep them up-to-date but the process is no way real-time :) This is just my way to fight the notorious JS fatigue by keeping the bigger picture at hand. Hope this stuff may be helpful to someone. Any feedback is welcome!
